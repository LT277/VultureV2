nn1.py is just figuring out how to get a nn to work with numpy and python.
The inital code is from:
https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1

Inital dataset (train idx3) is from:

nn2.py is similar in concept to nn1.py. However it uses keras instead of just numpy.
code is from: https://becominghuman.ai/building-an-image-classifier-using-deep-learning-in-python-totally-from-a-beginners-perspective-be8dbaf22dd8

nn3.py Is the start of a more finalized neural network based on nn2.py, and training.py from Vulture-Team.
It is made to work alongside Driver.py and image_manipulation.py to provide a working model, that is not too difficult to read and understand.
